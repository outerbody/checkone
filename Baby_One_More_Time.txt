'''''...Baby One More Time''''' is the [[debut album]] from [[United States of America|American]] [[pop music|pop]] [[singer]]  [[Britney Spears]]. It was released on [[January 12]], [[1999]], in the U.S. and was principally produced by [[Max Martin]] and [[Rami]] (and was largely composed by the former). The [[...Baby One More Time (song)|title track]], which is her most successful single to date, is generally considered Spears' [[signature song]]. Although she herself had very minimal artistic input with this record, it is her best-selling album both in the U.S. and internationally and propelled the then-seventeen-year-old to superstardom during the year of its release.

Although the critical response to the album was lukewarm, ''...Baby One More Time'' was a huge commercial success. It debuted at number one in both the U.S. and [[Canada]], and reached the top ten in many other countries. The record has been certified [[RIAA certification|14x Platinum]] in the U.S. (making it one of the top fifty best-selling albums of all-time domestically) and has sold over twenty-five million copies worldwide.
